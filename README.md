# Fair-Fare

Created for Public Policy Analytics at the University of Pennsylvania by Emily Branch and Vrinda Agarwal, *Fair Fare* is a multinomial logistic regression model and wireframe for a public-facing, transit authority-operated app that will mitigate overcrowding on trains and inefficient operations. *Fair Fare* aims to achieve these goals by predicting train occupancy, allowing users to make informed decisions about which trains to ride and transit authorities to implement a dynamic pricing model that will redistribute crowds. On trains with a high predicted occupancy, Fair Fare suggests that ticket prices are raised 15%, while trains with a low predicted occupancy should have their prices reduced by 15%. This way, riders are encouraged to choose low-occupancy trains, boosting operational efficiency, and avoid high-occupancy trains, reducing crime.
